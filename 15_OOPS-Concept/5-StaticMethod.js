/*
## What is static method?
-> The JavaScript provides static methods that belong to the class instead of an instance of that class. 
   So, an instance is not required to call the static method. These methods are called directly on the class itself.

-> In JavaScript, static methods are methods defined on the class itself, rather than on instances of the class.
   These methods are called directly on the class (or constructor function) without the need to instantiate an object.


## Points to remember:
1. The static keyword is used to declare a static method.
2. The static method can be of any name.
3. A class can contain more than one static method.
4. If we declare more than one static method with a similar name, the JavaScript always invokes the last one.
5. The static method can be used to create utility functions.
6. We can use this keyword to call a static method within another static method.
7. We cannot use this keyword directly to call a static method within the non-static method. In such case,
   we can call the static method either using the class name or as the property of the constructor.

1. Defining a Static Method
-> Define a static method, the static keyword is used before the method definition.

class Driver {
  drive1(name, model) {
    return `${name} drive ${model} car.`;
  }

  static drive2(name, model) {
    return `${name} drive ${model} car.`;
  }
}

const d1 = new Driver();
console.log(d1.drive1("Rohit", "Tata Harrier")); // Output: Rohit drive Tata Harrier car.

// if we use static method then access directly like below
console.log(Driver.drive2("Akhil", "Benz")); // Output: Akhil drive Benz car.

class Calculator {
  // Static method
  static add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }

  // Instance method
  subtract(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  }
}

// Call static method directly on the class
console.log(Calculator.add(5, 3)); // Output: 8

// Cannot call a static method on an instance
const calc = new Calculator();
// console.log(calc.add(5, 3)); // Error: calc.add is not a function

// Call instance method on the object
console.log(calc.subtract(5, 3)); // Output: 2

/*
2. When to Use Static Methods
-> Static methods are useful for operations that are related to the class but donâ€™t need to access or modify
   any specific instance data. */

class User {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  // Static method to compare two users by age
  static compareAge(user1, user2) {
    return `The difference age b/w ${user1.name} & ${user2.name} = ${
      user1.age - user2.age
    }`;
  }
}

const user1 = new User("Rohit", 26);
const user2 = new User("Nikhil", 10);

// Compare users by age using static method
console.log(User.compareAge(user1, user2));

/*
3. Static Methods in Constructor Functions
-> Static methods can also be added to constructor functions (older JavaScript syntax) by assigning them
   directly to the constructor. */
